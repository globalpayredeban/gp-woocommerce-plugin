### 3.1 Installation and Activation Through Wordpress Admin
When we have the project compressed in .zip format, we proceed to the installation through Wordpress Admin.

1. The first step will be to login into Wordpress Admin as administrator.

2. Being in the main screen of the admin we click on the Plugins tab.

3. Within the Plugins screen we click on Add New.

4. Within the Add Plugins screen we click on Upload Plugin.

5. The option to upload our plugin in .zip format will be displayed. We upload it and click on the Install Now button.

6. We will be redirected to the plugin installation screen. We wait to get the message Plugin installed successfully and click on the Activate Plugin button.

7. We will be redirected to the Plugins screen where we will see our plugin installed and activated.

## 4. Activation and Configuration of the Plugin in WooCommerce
After having installed our plugin in Wordpress we must proceed to configure it in the WooCommerce admin.

This is found in the WooCommerce tab of the main WordPress admin. Then we click on the Settings option and later on the Payments tab.

###Â 4.1 Payment Gateway Activation
To activate our payment gateway within WooCommerce we need to be within **WooCommerce -> Settings -> Payments** and we will see our plugin installed and detected.

To enable it we must activate the Enabled button. This enablement is different from that of Wordpress which we did previously.

### 4.2 Gateway Settings in WooCommerce Admin
By enabling our plugin in the WooCommerce admin, we will have some options to configure. To do this we click on the Manage button that will appear on the side of our plugin.

The options to configure are the following:

- **Staging Environment:** When enabled, the plugin will point to the Globalpay staging server.

- **Enable LinkToPay:** If selected, LinkToPay(Bank transfer, cash) can be used to pay.

- **Title:** This option configures the text that the customer will see in the checkout window next to the Globalpay logo.

- **Customer Message:** This option configures the message that the customer will see in the checkout window when they select Globalpay as the payment method.

- **Checkout Language:** This option selects the language that will be displayed in the checkout window. The available options are Spanish, Portuguese and English (by default).

- **Installments Type:** Select the installments type that will be enabled on the payment screen (Only on card payment).

- **App Code Client:** Unique identifier in Globalpay.

- **App Key Client:** Key used to encrypt communication with Globalpay.

- **App Code Server:** Unique identifier on the Globalpay server.

- **App Key Server:** Key used for communication with the Globalpay server.

## 5.- Selecting the Plugin in the Store Checkout
When we have all our plugin activated and configured in WooCommerce, we will see it available to be selected by customers on the Checkout page of our store.

Just select it, fill in the Billing Details and click on the Place Order button.

By clicking we will arrive at the Order-Pay or Pay For Order window in which we will see a summary of our order. The Purchase button will be displayed which will open the payment checkout.

## 6. Process to make a Refund
The refund process will start in the main Wordpress admin window.

We select the WooCommerce tab and click on the Orders option.

We select the order that we want to refund and the Edit Order window will open.

In the item detail we will find the **Refund** button, we click and the refund options will be displayed.

We type the amount to be reimbursed and click the **Refund via Globalpay** button. The status within WooCommerce will change and so will the status on the gateway.

## 7. Webhook Configuration
The plugin includes the functionality of a webhook to receive the transaction updates that are made. This webhook receives transaction notifications and updates them in the WooCommerce admin and database.

To configure it, the merchant must provide its **Globalpay** commercial advisor with the address where the webhook is installed, it will be in the following format: https://{{URL-COMMERCE}}/wp-content/plugins/gp-woocommerce-plugin/includes/gp-woocommerce-webhook.php.
